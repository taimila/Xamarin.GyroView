# Xamarin.GyroView
Emulate the Apple TV 3D Parallax effect on iPhone and iPad using Xamarin.

This is more or less direct port of the original [Swift implementation](https://github.com/zrubenst/GyroView) by [Zack Rubenstein](https://github.com/zrubenst). This port is implemented with C# and can be easily used with Xamarin apps.

## Usage
Just copy the `GyroView.cs` into your project and use it. More information can be found at [original repository](https://github.com/zrubenst/GyroView).
